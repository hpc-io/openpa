OpenPA v0.0.1
-------------

TODO write some more content.

- give brief overview of project
- point to website and bug tracking
- explain how to build

% automake --add-missing
% autoreconf
% ./configure [configure_args]
% make
% make install

- mention known issues and supported platforms (in a different file?)

* One known issue is that the gcc atomic intrinsics aren't supported by
  compilers prior to GCC 4.1.  In particular the Mac OS X compiler is gcc 4.0.1
  so these result in a linker error when using this set of primitives.  The good
  news is that on osx/intel we use native inline assembly anyway, so this isn't
  a big problem.
